# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Treat CMS database migrations as part of the installation/module lifecycle
  instead of a manual user setup step.
- Discover CMS migrations and seeders from module-owned database directories
  only.
- Moved CMS architecture notes to the monorepo documentation.
- Kept the public CMS Composer manifest runtime-only and moved development
  tooling to the monorepo development manifest.
- Excluded development-only analysis, test, and local manifest files from CMS
  release archives.

### Fixed

- Fixed admin asset output paths to avoid nested `/admin/assets/assets/...`
  URLs.
- Added an SVG favicon for the admin shell.
- Fixed CMS PHPStan analysis without relying on a local `ModelQuery` stub.

### Removed

- Removed the CMS-local `bin/database` wrapper in favor of the framework
  database console for development and maintenance tasks.
- Removed empty global CMS `database/migrations` and `database/seeds`
  directories.
- Removed obsolete CMS-local Docker nginx and Dev Container configuration.
- Removed the CMS-local PHPStan `ModelQuery` stub.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- Renamed Xen CMS to Annabel CMS.
- Moved canonical development into the Annabel monorepo.
- Renamed the Composer package to `codemonster-ru/annabel-cms`.
- Renamed the PHP namespace to `Codemonster\Cms`.
- Added a monorepo development manifest backed by local Annabel packages.
- Added compiled admin assets to the release artifact.
- Updated Docker and Dev Container startup to install and build frontend
  dependencies.

### Removed

- Removed the `Codemonster\Xen` namespace and Xen-specific configuration names.

## [0.4.0] – 2026-01-22

### Changed

- ModuleManager now discovers modules by directory and supports modules without
  a `ModuleServiceProvider` by auto-wiring view namespaces and routes.
- Module listing now reports modules without providers as `(auto)`.

### Removed

- Removed Admin, Auth, and Pages `ModuleServiceProvider` classes in favor of
  auto module wiring.

## [0.3.0] – 2026-01-07

### Added

- Auth module with registration, login, profile, and logout flows.
- Auth models for users/roles with role assignment helpers.
- Auth module migrations for users, roles, and role_user pivot tables.
- Roles seeder for default `user` and `admin` roles.
- Auth views for login, register, and profile (CSRF-ready forms).
- Database CLI wrapper (`bin/database`) plus migration/seed path bootstrap
  helpers.
- Database and security configuration files.
- ORM service provider to bind model connections.
- Security service provider wrapper.
- Global migrations/seeds folders with `.gitkeep` placeholders.

### Changed

- Simplified `ModuleServiceProvider`: removed router controller factory binding,
  as this is now handled by Annabel core.
- AuthMiddleware now receives an explicit access context `'admin'` when applied
  to the Admin route.
- Admin access now uses strict auth validation (DB check every request) to
  protect `/admin`.
- Registration now runs in a transaction; failures no longer leave orphaned
  users.
- Auth routes now use `/login`, `/register`, `/profile`, and `/logout` with
  middleware and throttling.
- Auth login view now uses email/password fields and CSRF token.
- View namespaces standardized to lowercase `views` paths across modules.
- Pages home view copy now reflects the lowercase `views` path.
- README expanded with migrations, seeders, and auth route documentation.
- `.env` is now ignored by git.
- Updated dependencies (Annabel ^1.14, Security ^1.1).

### Fixed

- Session auth now re-validates users on a TTL to avoid stale logins in
  guest/auth middleware.
- Registration errors surface in debug mode; production keeps a generic
  message.
- User/Role hydration now preserves `id` by allowing it in `fillable`.

### Removed

- Legacy admin-only `LoginController` and `/admin/login` route.

## [0.2.0] – 2025-10-19

### Added

- **Modular architecture** — Xen now loads multiple independent modules
  (`Core`, `Admin`, `Pages`) with their own routes, controllers, and views.
- **Controller factory integration** — controllers are now automatically
  resolved through Annabel's container.
- **Admin module** — introduced the `/admin` area with a `DashboardController`
  and middleware-ready routing.
- **Core module routing** — system routes are now registered through
  `ModuleServiceProvider`, ensuring clean initialization order.
- **Router helpers** — added global `router()` and `route()` functions for
  concise route registration.
- **View modular loading** — module-specific templates can now be resolved
  automatically through namespace mapping.

### Changed

- Updated bootstrap flow — the CMS boot process now initializes the router
  before module bootstrapping.
- Improved internal service provider logic for better module isolation and
  loading order.
- Simplified module routing: all module `web.php` files are automatically loaded
  if they exist.

### Fixed

- Fixed early `Router instance not available` errors during module boot.
- Fixed missing controller dependencies when dispatching through the router.
- Fixed trailing slash inconsistencies in route matching (`/admin` and
  `/admin/` now resolve identically).

## [0.1.0] – 2025-10-18

### Added

- **Xen Core Module** — a basic system module that automatically initializes all
  other CMS modules.
- **ModuleManager** — dynamically finds and loads all `ModuleServiceProvider` in
  `app/Modules/*`.
- **Automatic Bootstrapping** — `bootstrap/app.php` is now minimal, and the Xen
  core is automatically included.
- **View namespaces** — added support for `$view->addNamespace()` for templates
  within modules.
- **Pages module example** — added a basic `Pages` module with the `/` route and
  the `pages::home` template.

### Changed

- Simplified startup: the CMS now fully loads with `composer start`,
  eliminating the need to manually register modules.
- The Annabel framework is integrated with Xen via the `Core` system module.

### Fixed

- Fixed issues with 404 errors on startup and incorrect module loading.
- Fixed `Undefined array key` errors when searching for `namespace` in
  `ModuleManager`.
